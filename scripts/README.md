# Pony

The appropriately named pony script (mostly AI generated) is a tool to help analyze sound files. It takes a `.wav` file as parameter and will open a GUI where you'll see a frequency spectrum (FFT plot). The idea is that you click on any peaks you see. Select exactly 8 peaks, then click `Make it so`. This will output values that can be included in Pockyplocky.

This process is hit and miss. It works well for some sounds (Xylophone, my metal pan), but not so well for some others I've tried.
